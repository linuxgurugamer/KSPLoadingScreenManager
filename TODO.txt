ToDo

To each FOLDER section
	Add logoScreen
	Add logoTip

	All logo Screens and their associated logoTip will be displayed first, followed by all other screens

Add ability to read multiple config files.  
Initial config file loaded will be the LSM config, all other files in PluginData will then be read.
All additional config files will only read the FOLDER node, as well as logoScreen and logoTip
